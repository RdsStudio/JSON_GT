But you need to tame them first. Tame them with honeycomb, it might take a few tries! Then when you see those loving hearts, you know it’s time to ride.\n\nBees struggle to go uphill when being flown. You are heavy and they are a tiny bee after all. Drag them up a hill with a lead, then set flight over valleys and watch the sunset.\n\nVisit www.jigarbov.net for more cool Minecraft stuff… Want to support me?

For example, the radio can be used for playing songs and the fridge can be used for storing food items. But the main and most important part is the fact that they look really good and can also be used just as decorations for your builds.",
